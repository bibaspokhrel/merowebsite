    <h5>Welcome to everyone on this page. This is november third and i am currently running the useless version of it.</h5><br>
    <pr>Ok, this website is thought to be kind of a blog type.. but not that simple. It should work pretty well and have you know, cool animation also. but it doesn't work like that in real life. So this is for purely educational purposes.</pr><br>
    <br>

    <pr>This page is made only using html and no css. Simple tags are being used.So, there's a long way to go to develop it into a fully useful version that works properly.</pr>
